# Tic Tac Toe

## Assignment instructions from The Odin Project (TOP)

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

1. Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
2. 
3. Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.

## Updates:
To start practising rspec testing, I created helper methods to split up the long complex methods and added tests for `#create_player`, `#increase_total_number_players_by_one`, `#assign_player`and `#request_player_token_choice`.
